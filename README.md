# GCP IAM Policies

This repository was created when I was having troubles understanding iam policies
in our GCP environment and I needed to clear all the 3 different ways terraform
exposes this functionality to be managed. 

I even wrote a blog regarding my findings you can check it out here

https://devops-stuff.dev/blogs/terraform/gcp-iam-member-binding-policy

The folders are numbered in the order of which I created them to understand the
concepts.

[1-iam_policy](./1-iam_policy/)
[2-iam_policy_binding](./2-iam_policy_binding/)
[3-iam_policy_binding](./3-iam_policy_binding/)
[4-iam_policy_member](./4-iam_policy_member/)
[5-iam_policy_member](./5-iam_policy_member/)

If you are also here to understand these things I would suggest you to read the
blog and follow along with the code that I have provided here.

Most probably you could even just run these terraform codes and it should be fine
